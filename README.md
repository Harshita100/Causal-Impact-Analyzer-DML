# Causal-Impact-Analyzer-DML
This project applies Double Machine Learning to quantify the causal impact of IPL match days and Diwali firecrackers on air pollution in Ahmedabad and Delhi. It builds counterfactual pollution trends, controls for weather and seasonal confounders, and uses real-world datasets from public APIs to deliver a policy-focused environmental analysis.
